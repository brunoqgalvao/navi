# Brand Alignment Improvements

## Changes Implemented

### Visual Identity & Branding
- **Typography**: Switched primary headings ("Claude Code", "Create New Project", "Start a conversation") to `font-serif`. This aligns better with the sophisticated, literary aesthetic of the Claude brand.
- **Logo Area**: Simplified the logo container. Removed the rotation animation and heavy shadows for a more static, stable look.
- **Color Palette**: Shifted from a colorful dashboard (blues and greens) to a **monochrome/neutral** palette. This feels more professional and less "playful SaaS".

### Component Refinements
- **"Create New Project" Button**:
    - Changed shape from pill (`rounded-full`) to `rounded-lg` for a more "tool-like" structure.
    - Kept the dark theme but refined the hover states.
- **Project & Chat Cards**:
    - Removed colored backgrounds from icons.
    - Used `bg-gray-50` and `text-gray-400/600` for a clean, minimal look.
    - Simplified hover interactions (subtle background change instead of lift/translate).
    - Reduced visual noise by removing heavy dividers and colored text on hover.

### Overall Layout
- Maintained the centered, spacious layout but with cleaner lines and less distraction.
- The focus is now strictly on the content (project names and chat titles) rather than UI decoration.
