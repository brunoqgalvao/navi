# Navi App TODO

## UI Improvements

### Header / Navigation
- [ ] Add "Open in..." dropdown menu at the top (similar to Cursor)
  - Finder - open project folder
  - Cursor - open in Cursor IDE
  - Terminal - open terminal at project path
  - VS Code - open in VS Code
  - Copy path - copy project path to clipboard

### Chat View
- [ ] Add scroll-to-bottom button when user is not at the end of the conversation
  - Show floating button when scrolled up
  - Hide when at bottom
  - Smooth scroll animation on click

### Image Preview
- [ ] Close image preview modal with ESC key
  - Add keyboard event listener for Escape key
  - Should close any opened preview image

### Empty State

  - Better messaging for new vs resumed conversations
  - Maybe show suggestions or quick actions
  - More engaging visual design
