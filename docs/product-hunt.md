## Maker Comment
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Navi because I wanted a better way to work with AI assistants.
The CLI is great, but sometimes you want:
• Visual previews of what you're building
• Easy file navigation
• Multiple AI agents working in parallel
• Everything local and fast

Navi is 100% open source (MIT license).

## First Comment (Post)

🎉 Thanks for checking out Navi!

A few things that make it special:

**Multi-Agent Coordination**
Spawn specialist agents (browser, coding, runner) that work in parallel. Each has its own context and UI.

**Live Previews**
See URLs, files, and markdown rendered right next to your chat. No tab switching.

**Extensible**
Drop in custom Skills to add capabilities. We ship with playwright, integrations (Gmail, Slack, etc.), and more.

**Local-First**
Your data stays on your machine. SQLite database, in-memory API keys, nothing sent to the cloud except Anthropic API calls.

**Open Source**
MIT license. Contribute, fork, customize.

## Discussion Questions (to engage with comments)

### "This looks amazing! What's your favorite feature?"
"My favorite is the multi-agent system. Being able to spawn a browser agent to research something while a coding agent implements it – all in parallel – is a game changer for complex tasks."

### "How does this compare to Cursor / Windsurf?"
"Great question! Navi is focused on being a GUI for Claude Code specifically, with a few key differences:
1. Multi-agent coordination – parallel AI agents with visual hierarchy
2. Local-first – your data never leaves your machine
3. Highly extensible – Skills system lets you add custom capabilities
4. Open source – free and MIT-licensed"

### "Will there be a Windows version?"
"Yes! Windows support is planned. Currently Navi runs on macOS and Linux. We're working on Windows compatibility – follow the repo for updates!"

### "Can I use this with other AI providers?"
"Right now Navi is optimized for Claude via the claude-agent-sdk. We're exploring support for other providers in the future. If you're interested in contributing multi-provider support, we'd love the help!"

### "What's the tech stack?"
"Svelte 5 for the frontend (new runes syntax is great!), Tauri v2 for the desktop wrapper, and Bun for the backend server. The database is SQLite (sql.js) and we use the claude-agent-sdk for AI."
