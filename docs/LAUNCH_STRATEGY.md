Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Navi because I wanted a better way to work with AI assistants.
The CLI is great, but sometimes you want:
- Visual previews of what you're building
- Easy file navigation
- Multiple AI agents working in parallel
- Everything local and fast

Navi is 100% open source (MIT license).
I'd love your feedback and contributions!
