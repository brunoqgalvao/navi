# Vibe Coding Project

This project uses the **vibe coder pipeline** - a structured 3-agent approach to building apps from rough ideas.

## How We Work

1. **Spec First** - No code until we have a bulletproof SPEC.md
2. **Plan Before Build** - Deep research and architecture in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
3. **Execute Precisely** - Follow the plan, don't improvise

## Available Skills

- `vibe-coder` - The full 3-agent pipeline (Spec → Plan → Implement)
- `ship-it` - Deploy to production when ready
- `generate-logo` - Create branding assets

## Key Files

- `SPEC.md` - Project specification (generated by Spec Agent)
- `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Architecture and task breakdown (generated by Plan Agent)
- `CHANGELOG.md` - What was built and when

## Quick Start

Just describe what you want to build:

> "I want to build a CLI tool that tracks my coffee consumption"

The vibe coder will:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Generate a spec for your approval
3. Create an implementation plan
4. Build it step by step

## Deployment

When you're ready to go live:

> "ship it"

Your app will be deployed to `*.usenavi.app`

## Tips

- Be descriptive in your initial idea - more context = better spec questions
- Review SPEC.md before approving the plan
- Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md before implementation starts
- Keep the todo list updated as work progresses
